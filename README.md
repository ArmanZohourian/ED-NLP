## NLP Project 2025

We fine-tuned a model from HuggingFace in the Jupyter Notebook. The checkpoints from model training get saved in the repository to the folder `output_dir`.

The file `main.py` can run predictions using the method `predict` by accessing the stored model weights.


The size of our project exceeds the upload size of files in ILIAS, therefore we provide the link to our GitHub project [here](https://github.com/ArmanZohourian/ED-NLP), which includes everything.
